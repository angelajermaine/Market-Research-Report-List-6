<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Natural Film Forming Polymers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Soluble</li><li>Oil Soluble</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Natural film-forming polymers are classified into two main types based on their solubility: water-soluble and oil-soluble. Water-soluble polymers, such as gelatin and alginate, easily dissolve in water and create films that offer transparency and flexibility, making them ideal for applications in food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. Oil-soluble polymers, like shellac and certain waxes, dissolve in oils and provide moisture resistance, enhancing the durability and barrier properties in coatings, adhesives, and packaging materials. Each type serves distinct industrial needs.</p></p>
