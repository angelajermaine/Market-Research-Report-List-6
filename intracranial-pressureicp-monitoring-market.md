<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intracranial Pressure(ICP) Monitoring Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Intracranial Pressure Monitor</li><li>Non-invasive Intracranial Pressure Monitor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intracranial Pressure (ICP) monitoring is crucial for assessing brain health, particularly in critical care scenarios. The market is divided into two main types: invasive and non-invasive monitors. Invasive ICP monitors involve the placement of devices directly inside the cranial cavity, providing precise readings but carrying risks of infection and complications. Non-invasive monitors utilize external methods to estimate ICP, offering safer alternatives with lower accuracy. Both types are essential in managing conditions like traumatic brain injury and hydrocephalus.</p></p>
